# Hydra
Repository for [CHRobotics](http://www.chrobotics.com) Hydra triple-output power supply with bluetooth control.

This was originally a [Kickstarter project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1107117096/hydra-a-triple-output-power-supply-for-electronics?ref=discovery) started in Feb, 2013.

Call for help:  If you are watching the repository and you have a Hydra, I could use your help in testing the features I've recently added.  Drop me an email and I will make you a build (Kurt Arnlund).
